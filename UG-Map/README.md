# UG MAP
This is a Java-based terminal program that demonstrates the use of Dijkstra algorithms to identify the optimum path in a graph.

- First, all of the vantage points on campus are modelled in a graph, along with their relative distances.

- In the program, the graph is represented by an adjancency list.

- The distances between the various locations were calculated in advance using Google Map API.

- The optimum path based on distances was determined using Dijstrak's algorithm.
